# Active-Directory-Project
This project aims to set up a realistic Active Directory (AD) environment with logging and monitoring capabilities using Splunk. It also demonstrates attack simulation using Kali Linux and Atomic Red Team to generate detectable telemetry in Splunk, simulating real-world attacks on the AD environment.

## Environment Setup
Network Setup:
- Domain Name: HomeLab
- Network (NAT): 192.168.15.0/24

Virtual Machines and Roles:
- Splunk Server (Ubuntu 22.04): ``` 192.168.15.10 ```
- Active Directory (Windows Server): ``` 192.168.15.5 ```
- Windows 10 Client (Target-PC): DHCP IP (domain-joined)
- Kali Linux (Attacker): ```192.168.15.250```

## Step 1: Setting Up the Splunk Server (Ubuntu)
Objective: Install and configure Splunk on Ubuntu to act as the primary log aggregator and SIEM for the environment.

### Detailed Steps:
1. Install Ubuntu 22.04 on VirtualBox:
- Set the network adapter to NAT Network.
- Assign a static IP of ``` 192.168.15.10 ``` to ensure it remains accessible.

2. Set Static IP:
- Edit the Netplan configuration to set the static IP:
``` sudo nano /etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml ```

- Add the following configuration:
```
network:
  ethernets:
    enp0s3:
      dhcp4: no
      addresses: [192.168.15.10/24]
      gateway4: 192.168.15.1
      nameservers:
        addresses: [8.8.8.8, 1.1.1.1]
  version: 2
```

- Apply changes:

```
sudo netplan apply
```

3. Download and Install Splunk:
- Download Splunk Enterprise for Linux from Splunkâ€™s website.
- Transfer the .deb file to the server, then install it:
```
sudo dpkg -i splunk-installer.deb
```

4. Configure Splunk:
- Start Splunk and set admin credentials:
```
cd /opt/splunk/bin
sudo ./splunk start --accept-license
```

- Enable Splunk to start on boot:
```
sudo ./splunk enable boot-start
```
